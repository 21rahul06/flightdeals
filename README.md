Developed a comprehensive system integrating Sheety, Amadeus, and Twilio APIs, along with SMTP for email notifications. The project retrieves flight data from a Google Sheet using the Sheety API, and utilizes the Amadeus API to find IATA codes and search for the best flight deals. Deals are compared against user-specified price thresholds, and if a deal falls below the threshold, the system automatically sends an SMS alert via Twilio and a detailed email using SMTP. Additionally, integrated a Google Form to allow users to subscribe by submitting their email and preferences, ensuring they receive personalized flight deal alerts. This automation streamlines the process of monitoring flight prices and sending timely notifications to users.
